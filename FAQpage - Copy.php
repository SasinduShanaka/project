                    <h3>What is life insurance?</h3>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance company. The individual pays regular premiums, and in return, the insurer provides a lump-sum payment (called a death benefit) to the individual's beneficiaries after their death. It helps protect the financial future of loved ones, covering expenses like debts, income loss, or funeral costs. Common types include term (coverage for a set period) and whole life (lifetime coverage).</p>
